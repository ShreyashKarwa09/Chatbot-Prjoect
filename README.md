This the Chatbot project that I built.
Download the Files and to execute first install numpy,random,pickle,nltk,tensorflow and keras libraries.
then first execute training.py and wait to train the dataset.
Later execute app.py and the chatbot will be executed.
If you want to execute custom taining datasets change the intents.json file based on the data you need to train the chatbot.
